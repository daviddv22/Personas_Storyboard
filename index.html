      <h2>Interface: <br> Projection Console</h2>
      <p>After attending classes at Brown and likely most other colleges, you may have likely been projected a presentation or video for class.
        Almost all classrooms at Brown have projecting capabilities that is controlled through this projection console. It helps to consolidate 
        all the buttons required in the classroom into one interface. Did you know that you can control the room's
        lights, shades, and even audio from the same interface? This website's goal is to explore and analyze the structure of the interface.
        We will analyze the Projection interface in the context of its possible users.
        <!-- However, have you ever looked at the interface that is involved in controlling the projector? -->

          This is an interface that controls the projector, lights, shades, audio, and screen all in one location. It is used by
          many to project their screens, to show presentations, videos, and many more things. This interface aims to simplify the complex
          steps it would take to set up a room for a screen projection, as each object such as the lights and shades have their own set of controls. 
          There are many buttons on a projector and around the room that have been consolidated into this one interface!

          <br>
          The inital page is for fast and easy operations, with common fuction in the utility bar to the right of the screen.
          <br>
          Then there is an advance page that brings you to a series of other page to have more custimzation and control over the room.

      <h2>Key Observations:</h2>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p>
          Preface: We observed different users who used the projection console throughout Brown University buildings. We were able to observe professors, teaching assistants, and student to provide a sample that 
          represented different ages, jobs, nationalities and socioeconomic demographics since Brown's population is diverse.
          <ul><li>
          As people worked with the interface, they initally looked at the screen for a bit of time, before continuing with their task. 
          </li>
        <li>          Most users connected the projector with the HDMI cord and this worked about 75% of the time but when users ran into issues this with cord, users would default to AirMedia. 
        </li>
        <li>          Some people utilized the advanced screen to control the screen, lights, and shades in the room. 
        </li>
        <li>          Most people often seemed to make a confused face at time while interacting with the interface. 
        </li>
          <li>          Many users tapped the screen multiple times if it didn't respond quickly.
        </li></ul>
          <!-- Many people tap the interface to turn it on.  -->

      <h2>Questions and Responses:</h2>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>How would you describe the process of projecting your screen?</li>
          <ul><li>
            I expected a more automatic process, as the interface itself was not self explanatory making it hard to learn and find things that are needed, 
            which made using the interface complicated to use as there was not one clear way to do the task.
          </li></ul>
          <!-- <br>
          <br> -->
          <li>Could you craft an idea of what you should do next at each step?</li>
          <ul><li>
            It was not clear what should be done next at each step, and I made assumptions as labeling was weird and unclear, and both the simple and busy screens lead to exploration which
            distracted me from the task.
            <!-- if method of projection was better than the other and  -->
          </li></ul>
          <!-- <br>
          <br> -->
          <li>Did you expect things to go the way at each step?</li>
          <ul><li>
            Yes and no, there was no help when things go awry and there were too many options, making controls like video routing to be more confusing, but I would say that I needed the advanced options as basic was too basic.
          </li></ul>
          <!-- <br>
          <br> -->
          <li>How did you learn to use the interface? Was there any difficulties in doing so?</li>
          <ul><li>
           The interface was similar to a touch screen interface such as an IPad, and I made assumptions on the functionality with the labels, 
           however, labeling and intructions should have been clearer.
          </li></ul>
          <!-- <br>
          <br> -->
          <li>Can you describe your overall experience with this interface?</li>
          <ul><li>
            Overall, it was a frustrating experience as there were many unexpected problems that I ran into, and things did not often work on the first attempt, which lead to a feeling that
            the process should and could be easier and a feeling that it too longer than wanted to do the task.
          </li></ul>

      <h2>Empathy Maps:</h2>
      <p>Based on our observations and interviews, we can utilize that data to create personas and convey them with empathy maps</p>

      <h2>Storyboard:</h2>
      <p>To help us better understand our personas and their goals, we can create a storyboard that demonstrates our persona's goals, expectations, and experience using our selected interface.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p>
          <img class="StoryBoard" src="./assets/StoryBoard.jpeg" alt="annotated sketch of projector">

          This storyboard is for Susan Sugandee, who's goal is to be the best HTA that she can be. However, due to many commitments, she tends to rush through
          her tasks. She has had little time to prepare, but goes into class with a presentation. She see she has many options to present, and tries the easiest and most familiar option.
          However, this does not work which makes her frustrated as this had worked before, but she tries another method rahter than waste time. 
          Luckily there was a bit of guidance that allowed her to successfully project her computer screen.
          This persona did not want to waste her student's time and wanted to perform her duties correctly. This storyboard reflects 
          how the interface can be confusing and not work as expected at times, and can be frustrating at times.
